# PythonForDataAnalyst
In this repository, you will find all the small tasks which may include exercises, personal projects, or any knowledge related to Python, statistics, data visualization, etc..., that I am using to perform data analysis. The datasets in the project are sample datasets from various sources, often from two that I frequently use: IBM and Kaggle. This can be seen as evidence of my self-learning process in Data Analysis. The purpose of creating this repository is just that; you can view it without downloading or running any commands, as I use Anaconda-Navigator to execute.
